# June 4th: Develop the basic software

So I created a simulations of software and how I would wire a 16 neo pixels that changes the lights based on acceleration, and rotation. Now I just need to create the CAD model

# June 5th: Cadded the sword

Created what I wanted the sword to be like. The walls currently are only 1 mm thick and 1.25 mm apart which hopfully is thin enough for the light to go thur but doesn't break, I need some testing to be sure tho.
